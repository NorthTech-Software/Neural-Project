The Neural Project is an Open Source experiment of how people can train a computer by 'teaching' it things.

### What does the 'Brain' already know?
The 'Brain' only understands the date and time on first use, however you can train it to understand more things, and ask it questions on what it knows.

### How does the 'Brain' remember its memories?
The 'Brains' memories are stored locally in the APPDATA folder on your computer, it is inside a file called:
>brain_save.json

### How can I contribiute to the Project?
Feel free to fork the repository and make edits and create a pull request when you think you have made something to contribute.
